Windows XP Home Edition with Service Pack 3 Retail (x86) Original

This is the original release of Windows XP Home Edition Retail with SP3.

If you visit;  
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/subscriptions/downloads/default.aspx
and look for Windows XP Home with Service Pack 3 (x86) - CD (English), you can see the true SHA1 hash value which matches this one. 

As this is a retail version of XP it requires a fully genuine and valid license key. It would be pointless of me to provide a valid key because it would be in-valid after 3 people using it. Also, you can install this without a key but it requires you to enter one after 30 days. Lastly if you have your own key please use it.
